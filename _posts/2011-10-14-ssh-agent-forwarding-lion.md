It looks like in some occasions ssh agent (key) forwarding doesnâ€™t work anymore after upgrading to Mac OS Lion.

Gladly the solution is easy, you just need to run the following command in your Terminal and reboot after that.

**ssh-add**

This adds your identity back to the authentication agent again.
